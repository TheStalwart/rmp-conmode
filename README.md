# Stepmania 5.0 Convention Mode

Stepmania 5.0 default theme modded for public setups at cosplay conventions.

Target audience of our setups is casual, so we disable confusing settings and keybinds to funnel players into a couple popular songs with quality novice/easy beatmaps.

Theme is developed and tested on [Stepmania 5.0.12](https://www.stepmania.com/download/).

## Implemented overrides
- "Game start" in main menu goes directly to song list
    - "Caution!" screen is skipped
    - "Versus" Style is preselected
    - "Normal" PlayMode is preselected
- Default song grouping/sorting is set to "Player's Best!"
- Disabled menu music
